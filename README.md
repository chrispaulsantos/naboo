## Naboo
There is a lot of CSS functionality that I resue in all of the webapps that I create. To alleviate the need to recreate the classes every time, I decided to create this repository to house those classes, as well as some base styles I use as well. As always, this will grow as I continue to create new projects.

## Margin - .mx-y
For example, `.ml-2` gives a left margin of 1rem.

## Padding - .px-y
For example, `.p-0` gives padding of 0.

## Flex
Flex styles will typically follow the convention of their property naming: `.flex` will set the display to flex, `.justify-content-center` will set justify-content to center, and `.flex-row` will set flex-direction to row.

## Text
For text, there are a couple classes that use my default font colors to set the color of text. `.text-white`, for example will use my default white of #e8e8e8.

## Variables
Here are some variables that I set for reuse throughout all of the styles. Colors, shadows, and border-radius are a couple examples.
